- Add Unicode encodings that support BOMs.
- Change text_view to support use of range sentinels for end().
- Add transcoding support.
- Modify text_view and text iterators to derive from the codec
  state type only if the state type is an empty class and to
  declare a non-static data member otherwise.  This will reduce
  the size of text_view and text iterator objects when the codec
  state type is non-empty and has lower alignment requirements
  than the first non-static data member of the text_view and text
  iterator types.
- Add support for additional encodings...
