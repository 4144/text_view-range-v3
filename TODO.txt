- Remove codec min_code_units and max_code_units.  Doing so will require
  finding a new way to define the Random_access_codec concept.
- Add transcoding support.
- Add optimized character property predicates based on character set type.
- Add UDL (User Defined Literal) suffixes.
- Explore constexpr support.
- Modify codec encode() and decode() to return std::expected<bool>
  instead of throwing exceptions?
- Modify text_view and text iterators to derive from the codec
  state type only if the state type is an empty class and to
  declare a non-static data member otherwise.  This will reduce
  the size of text_view and text iterator objects when the codec
  state type is non-empty and has lower alignment requirements
  than the first non-static data member of the text_view and text
  iterator types.
- Add support for additional encodings...
