# [Text_view]
A [C++ Concepts][ISO/IEC 19217:2015]
based character encoding and code point enumeration library.

# Overview
[Text_view] provides iterator and range based interfaces for encoding and
decoding strings in a variety of character encodings.  The interface is
intended to support all modern and legacy character encodings, though
implementations are not yet available for legacy encodings.

An example usage follows.  Note that `\u00F8` (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE)
is encoded using two code units (`\xC3\xB8`), but iterator based enumeration
sees just the single code point.

```C++
using CT = utf8_encoding::character_type;
auto tv = make_text_view<utf8_encoding>(u8"J\u00F8erg is my friend");
auto it = tv.begin();
assert(*it++ == CT{0x004A}); // 'J'
assert(*it++ == CT{0x00F8}); // 'Ã¸'
assert(*it++ == CT{0x0065}); // 'e'
```

# Supported Encodings

# Requirements
[Text_view] requires a C++ compiler that implements [ISO/IEC technical
specification 19217:2015, **C++ Extensions for concepts**][ISO/IEC 19217:2015]
As of 2015-12-31, this specification is only supported by the current
in-development release of [gcc] that currently self-identifies itself as [gcc]
version 6.0.0.  Additionally, [Text_view] depends on the [Origin-text_view] fork
of [Andrew Sutton]'s [Origin] library for concept definitions.  The fork is
necessary to work around a few [gcc] defects and [Origin] issues that are
surfaced by [Text_view].

## Building and installing [gcc]
[Text_view] is known to build successfully with [gcc] svn revision 232017; the
top of trunk as of 2015-12-31.  The following commands can be used to perform a
suitable build of [gcc] on Linux that is known to successfully compile
[Text_view].

```sh
$ svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc-trunk-src
$ curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-5.1.1.tar.bz2
$ curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpfr/mpfr-3.1.2.tar.bz2
$ curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.0.1.tar.gz
$ cd gcc-trunk-src
$ svn update 32017  # Optional command to select a known good gcc version
$ bzip2 -d -c ../gmp-5.1.1.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
$ mv gmp-5.1.1 gmp
$ bzip2 -d -c ../mpfr-3.1.2.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
$ mv mpfr-3.1.2 mpfr
$ tar -zxvf ../mpc-1.0.1.tar.gz
$ mv mpc-1.0.1 mpc
$ cd ..
$ mkdir gcc-trunk-build
$ cd gcc-trunk-build
$ LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/$(gcc -print-multiarch); export LIBRARY_PATH
$ CPATH=/usr/include/$(gcc -print-multiarch); export CPATH
$ ../gcc-trunk-src/configure \
  CC=gcc \
  CXX=g++ \
  --prefix $(pwd)/../gcc-trunk-install \
  --disable-multilib \
  --disable-bootstrap \
  --enable-languages=c,c++
$ make -j 4
$ make install
$ cd ..
```

When complete, the new [gcc] build will be present in the `gcc-trunk-install`
directory.

## Building and installing [Origin-text_view]
[Text_view] does not currently build successfully with the top of trunk version
of the [Origin] library due to the following [Origin] and [gcc] issues:

1. https://github.com/asutton/origin/issues/5
2. https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69235
3. https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67565

The [Origin-text_view] fork of [Origin] was created to work around the above
issues.  The following commands can be used to perform a suitable build of
[Origin] on Linux that will work with [Text_view].  Note that these commands
assume that an appropriate build of [gcc] was performed and installed as per
the previous section.

```sh
$ PATH=$(pwd)/gcc-trunk-install/bin; export PATH
$ git clone https://github.com/tahonermann/origin.git origin-text_view-src
$ mkdir origin-text_view-build
$ cd origin-text_view-build
$ cmake ../origin-text_view-src \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$(pwd)/../origin-text_view-install
$ make install
$ cd ..
```

# Building and installing [Text_view]
[Text_view] is currently a header-only library, so no build or installation is
required.  It is unlikely that [Text_view] will remain a header-only library in
the future, so at some point, a build and installation step will be required.

[Text_view] currently has an exceedingly simple build system that is hard-coded
to look for [gcc] and [Origin] at specific locations.  This will change at some
point in the future, but given the present [gcc] and [Origin] requirements,
hasn't been a burden.  The build system is currently used to build and run a
few test programs.

The following commands suffice to build and run the test programs:

```sh
$ vi setenv-gcc-trunk.sh  # Update GCC_INSTALL_PATH and ORIGIN_INSTALL_PATH.
$ . ./setenv-gcc-trunk.sh
$ make
```

If the build succeeds, a few test and utility programs will be present in the
`bin` directory.

# Usage
[Text_view] is currently a header-only library.  To use it in your own code,
add include paths for the `text_view/include` and [Origin] installation
locations, and include the `text_view` header file:

```C++
#include <text_view>
```

All interfaces intended for public use are declared in the
`std::experimental::text` namespace.  The `text` namespace is an inline
namespace, so all entities are available from the `std::experimental` namespace
itself.
